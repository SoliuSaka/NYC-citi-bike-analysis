# NYC-citi-bike-analysis
This project analyzes Citi Bike usage in New York City to support the introduction of a bike-sharing system. It includes three subqueries: average trip duration by station, comparison of trip durations, and identification of the five stations with the longest mean trip durations. The insights will aid city officials in decision-making.
